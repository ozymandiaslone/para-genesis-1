# What in the world is this?

## im not really sure

### Para-Genesis is a simulation / video game where the player enters a universe based on simple rules.
## WORK IN PROGRESS
Right now, this project is in a relatively early stage of development. There is currently only one type of rocky body, and solar systems consist of 1 star + many rocky bodies. Collisions are just a placeholder right now, and will eventually be expanded to include fragmentation, and heat. (additionally, non-star bodies will be given more depth, with rocky bodies appearing as their namesage would suggest at lower masses and cooler temperatures, but at higher masses they will accumulate thick atmospheres of gas, and at high temperatueres their characteristics will change, such as to emit light)

I'm currenly working on implementing the concept of life / civilizations.

I am also working on a UI, but thats lower priority right now.

Eventually, I'm cooking up a plot; thats a distant one though.
